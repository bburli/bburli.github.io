Details of my work and passion.

Hello! I am Badari! Well, my full name is actually Badarinarayan but Badari will do just fine.

I have been programming since 2005 and professionally since 2010. This site introduces you (prospective employer, colleague or just someone who wants to know me) to some of my work and passion in software engineering.
